#+TITLE: mbzlists-resolvers

Content resolvers and playlist importers for XSPF files from [[https://mbzlists.com/][mbzlists]]. This is
under development so command line usage might change.

** Importing Playlists
For subsonic compatible media servers (including navidrome), do this:

#+begin_src shell
  # Set the following environment variables:
  # SS_HOST (something like http://192.168.0.101:4533), SS_USER, and SS_PASS

  mbzlists-resolvers <spiff-file> [optional playlist name]
#+end_src
